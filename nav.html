  For internal students, it is very important to attend lectures.  Lecturers will generally give an overview of the day’s topic, relate it to previous topics, and indicate important points, readings, debates and issues for you to consider. This is where you can extend your understanding of the topic, become aware of the lecturer’s perspective and emphasis and make notes of the important aspects of the lecture. You need to prepare before you attend the lecture, pay attention during the lecture and revise the lecture content afterwards.

 Tutorials enable you to build on and go into some of the lecture content in greater detail. In tutorials you have the opportunity to exchange ideas and views with other students and the tutor so that you can develop a fuller understanding of the topic and integrate ideas from your reading writing and lectures.

 Although not face-to-face, downloadable resources and materials are available to external students. In addition, online tutorials where students can communicate with their lecturer and other students in a synchronous Collaborate classroom provide similar opportunities for interactive tutorials. Most lecturers archive their online classes so even if you are unable to attend, you can follow the classroom discussion.

 From this page you can learn more about how to develop the skills you need to actively listen and take notes in lectures and tutorials, and about the kinds of presentations you might be expected to make in a tutorial
